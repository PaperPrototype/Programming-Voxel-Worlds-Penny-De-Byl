# Programming-Voxel-Worlds-Penny-De-Byl
My journey through Penny De Byl's course.
Here is a link to the course https://www.udemy.com/course/unityminecraft/

### Course_Work
Contains the regular course projects

### Faster_Chunks
Contains a full implementation of fast chunks. Originially 
Penny released a single fast chunks project but it was not 
fully implemented with the course. So I took the time to make 
working fast chunks projects that went along with the course.

### Side_Experiments
Contains a few unity projects with experiments I did.

### Smoothing
Conatins projects with neighbor based smoothing. It is also using the fast chunks implementation.

### Resources
Contains a couple of resources from Penny De Byl's course
